##Introduction
The CSES Problem Set is a collection of algorithmic programming problems.

The goal of the project is to create a comprehensive high quality problem set for learning algorithmic programming. The current collection has 300 problems, and new problems will be gradually added.

##Books

You can use the problem set together with recent competitive programming books, listed here(https://cses.fi/book/index.php). The books discuss techniques and ideas that are useful when solving the problems.

##License

The license of the problem set is Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0.
